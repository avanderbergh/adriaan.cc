# Hi, I'm Adriaan

## Developer, Educator, Innovator in Human-Centered Tech

I'm a web developer, educator, and tinkerer with a deep passion for technology and learning. Over the years, I've worked in various roles across education and development, always striving to build meaningful learning experiences and solve real-world problems with code. My approach is hands-on, and I find great joy in creating projects that bridge the gap between technology and human experience. I love experimenting with new technologies and finding creative ways to integrate AI into everyday tools, making technology both accessible and impactful.

I genuinely care about depth, practical solutions, and authentic communication. I believe that the best technology is not just clever but also truly useful—something that addresses real needs and brings value to people’s lives. Whether I'm coding a new feature, teaching others, or tinkering with an experimental idea, I approach every task with a sense of curiosity, attention to detail, and a desire to understand things fully. My experience in both educational environments and as a developer has taught me that learning is a lifelong journey, and every problem is an opportunity to grow and innovate.

Beyond technology, I enjoy working with people, sharing my knowledge, and learning from others. I’ve led workshops, coached aspiring developers, and collaborated on projects ranging from AI integrations to creative coding experiments. No matter the context, my aim is always the same: to bring curiosity, care, and a genuine drive for meaningful impact to everything I do.
